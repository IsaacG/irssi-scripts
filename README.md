irssi-scripts
=============

Random irssi scripts

* aliases.txt
 * A collection of aliases I wrote. Probably well out of date all the time.
* channotify.pl
 * Script that helps see the /notify list of people, filtered by shared channels.
* lastSpoke.pl
 * Show when a user last spoke in the current channel.
* listsort.pl
 * Sort the /list output (list of channels on the network) by channel size.
* pushover.pl
 * Push hilight messages (and others) to Pushover.net (which pushes it to your phone/computer).
* run.pl
 * Random collection of shell commands to run, triggered by a "trigger" like !uptime
* url_log.pl
 * Not mine. Tweaked it a bit for my needs, though.
* urltitles.pl
 * Capture URLs in channels and show the HTML title for that page.
