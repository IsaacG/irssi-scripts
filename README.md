irssi-scripts
=============

Random irssi scripts

* aliases.txt
 * A collection of aliases I wrote. Probably well out of date all the time.
* allwin.pl
 * Adapted from hilightwin.pl, print a copy of all (incoming) messages to one window for a general overview of all your channels and queries.
* aspell.pl
 * Early attempt at adding a spellchecker. DO NOT USE. https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/blob/master/scripts/aspell.pl is loosely based on this and far, far better.
* channotify.pl
 * Script that helps see the /notify list of people, filtered by shared channels.
* gmail-win.pl
 * Checks gmail to see if you got new unread emails.
* lastSpoke.pl
 * Show when a user last spoke in the current channel.
* listsort.pl
 * Sort the /list output (list of channels on the network) by channel size.
* pushover.pl
 * Push hilight messages (and others) to Pushover.net (which pushes it to your phone/computer).
* run.pl
 * Random collection of shell commands to run, triggered by a "trigger" like !uptime
* url_log.pl
 * Not mine. Tweaked it a bit for my needs, though.
* urltitles.pl
 * Capture URLs in channels and show the HTML title for that page.
* word-replace.pl
 * Automatically correct common typos using a dictionary of word-to-replacement.
